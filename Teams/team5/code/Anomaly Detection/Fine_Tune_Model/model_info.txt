Model File Information
=====================

This directory should contain the pre-trained vision transformer model for redshift prediction.

Expected file: Mixed_Inception_z_VITAE_Base_Img_Full_New_Full.pt

Model Specifications:
- Architecture: Vision Transformer (ViT)
- Input: 32x32 pixel astronomical images
- Output: Redshift prediction (continuous value)
- Parameters: ~125M
- Size: ~245 MB

The model should be trained on SDSS astronomical data and fine-tuned for redshift prediction.

Note: The actual model file is not included in this repository due to size constraints.
Please download the model from the appropriate source or train it using the provided scripts.
