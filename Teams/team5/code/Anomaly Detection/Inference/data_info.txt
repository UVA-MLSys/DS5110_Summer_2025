Data File Information
====================

This directory should contain the processed astronomical data for inference.

Expected file: resized_inference.pt

Data Specifications:
- Format: PyTorch tensor
- Shape: [N, 3, 32, 32] where N is the number of samples
- Content: Astronomical images from SDSS survey
- Preprocessing: Resized to 32x32 pixels, normalized

The data file should contain:
1. Astronomical images (32x32 pixels, 3 channels)
2. Corresponding photometric magnitudes (u, g, r, i, z bands)
3. Redshift targets for evaluation

Note: The actual data file is not included in this repository due to size constraints.
Please download the SDSS data and preprocess it according to the specifications in the README.
